# Sequence Master Game

## Description

Sequence Master is a browser-based interactive memory game created with jQuery, in which players are challenged to memorize and replicate a sequence of flashing colors. Each successful attempt leads to an incrementally longer sequence, testing the player's memory and concentration as they progress through the levels.
